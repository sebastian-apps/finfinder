# finfinder

Finfinder automatically finds the page numbers corresponding to the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement in annual financial statements PDFs. Page numbers are detected with a Naive Bayes classifier.

Finfinder is great where financial data are not readily available and organized in a database. For example, SEDAR.com offers all Canadian public securities documents in PDF form, but rarely in XBLR format. This is where Finfinder helps by parsing through PDFs to detect the location of important financial data. 

Future versions of Finfinder will extract, transform, and load the financial data.
