# finfinder

Finfinder automatically finds the page numbers corresponding to the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement in annual financial statements PDFs. Page numbers are detected with a trained Naive Bayes classifier.

Finfinder is great where financial data is not readily available and organized in a database. For example, SEDAR.com offers all Canadian public securities documents in PDF form, but rarely in XBLR format. This is where Finfinder can help parse through thousands of PDFs to detect the location within the PDF of important financial data. Future versions of Finfinder will ETL financial data obtained from the Income Statement, Balance Sheets, and Cashflow Statement.
